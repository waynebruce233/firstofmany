        <em> I would picplay a major role in almost any job, because you always deal with people. 
            That’s why I always try to look at things from theperspective of the person I am
            talking to. When it comes to areas of improvement, I could definitely improve my 
            computer skills,time management, and punctuality. I am aware of my weaknesses,and know I cannot
            afford to be ten minutes late to every other meeting, if I want to be successful as a Software Developer.
            That’s why I started to reminders,and I also try to plan my working day in advance. Anyway, there’s still a lot of room for improvement.
